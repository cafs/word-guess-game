### Hangman

This app tracks and updates the number of guesses remaining, correct and incorrect letters already guessed, and the users score for the amount of correctly guessed words. Key events listen for the letters that the user types. After the user wins/loses, another word is automatically chosen. this also resets the number of guesses remaining, letters guessed and a new game begins.

If the word is `madonna`, when the game starts it is displayed as `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.
As the user guesses correct letters, they are revealed `m a d o _  _ a`.
